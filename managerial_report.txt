Example 1: 
<task> the total revenue of Product A </task>
<sql>
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    SUM(od.price * od.quantity) AS total_revenue
FROM 
    product p
JOIN 
    order_detail od
ON 
    p.product_id = od.product_id
WHERE 
    p.product_name = 'Product A'
GROUP BY 
    p.product_name;

</sql>

Example 2: 

 <task>the revenue aggregate by months and products, and then pivot the result so that the columns represent products and the rows represent year-month </task>


 <sql>
-- Aggregate revenue by year-month and product
WITH revenue_by_month_product AS (
    SELECT 
        TO_CHAR(order_head.order_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS year_month,
        product.product_name,
        SUM(order_detail.price * order_detail.quantity) AS revenue
    FROM 
        order_head
    JOIN 
        order_detail ON order_head.order_id = order_detail.order_id
    JOIN 
        product ON order_detail.product_id = product.product_id
    GROUP BY 
        TO_CHAR(order_head.order_date, 'YYYY-MM'), product.product_name
)

-- Pivot the result
SELECT 
    year_month,
    COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN product_name = 'Product A' THEN revenue END), 0) AS "Product A",
    COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN product_name = 'Product B' THEN revenue END), 0) AS "Product B",
    COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN product_name = 'Product C' THEN revenue END), 0) AS "Product C",
    COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN product_name = 'Product D' THEN revenue END), 0) AS "Product D"
FROM 
    revenue_by_month_product
GROUP BY 
    year_month
ORDER BY 
    year_month;

 </sql>
